<h1>My Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>La La Land</h3>
<p>Great soundtrack, a great story, unexpected ending. A movie for Dreamers, just like me.</p>

<br />

<h3>Call Me By Your Name</h3>
<p>Set in the beautiful scenery in Northern Italy with a notable lead role of Timoth√©e Chalamet. </p>

<br />

<h3>Jojo Rabbit</h3>
<p>Heartwarming yet dark and twisted, a satire with a profound meaning. As a plus, I'm a fan of Taika Waititi and his works.</p>
